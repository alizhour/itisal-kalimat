    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the <strong>اتصال الكلمات</strong> app
      (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, created by
      <strong>Ali Zhour</strong> from <strong>naqnaqa (نقنقة)</strong> game studio
      (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
    </p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Application may collect limited data when used, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
      <li>Operating system</li>
      <li>App usage statistics (e.g., pages visited, time spent)</li>
      <li>Game progress and achievements (when using cloud save features)</li>
      <li>Account information when connecting through Google (Android) or Apple ID (iOS) for progress synchronization</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data is used to improve the app, ensure a safe user experience, and provide cloud save functionality for game progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >No personally identifiable information is knowingly collected from
        children under 13.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Cloud Save and Account Integration</h2>
    <p>
      The Application uses Firebase services to provide cloud save functionality. Users can connect their Google account (on Android) or Apple ID (on iOS) to save and synchronize their game progress across devices. This connection is optional and users can play without linking an account.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you choose to connect your account, we may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic profile information (username/display name)</li>
      <li>Game progress data and achievements</li>
      <li>Device identifiers for synchronization purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The Application offers in-app purchases for additional features or content. Please note that <strong>all purchases are final and non-refundable</strong> unless required by applicable law. Purchases are processed through the respective app store (Google Play Store or Apple App Store) and are subject to their terms and conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Application is suitable for all ages, including children under 13. We
      do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If a parent
      or guardian believes that a child has provided us with personal
      information, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:sajed.atwe@gmail.com">sajed.atwe@gmail.com</a> and we will
      delete the data immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use third-party services that follow child-appropriate privacy
      practices, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank"
          >Firebase (Google)</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6223431?hl=en"
          target="_blank"
          >AdMob (with child-directed treatment)</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank"
          >Unity</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ads and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      The app may display ads and collect analytics through third-party
      providers. If the app is being used by a child, the ads are configured to
      show <strong>non-personalized ads only</strong> and comply with COPPA
      regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>Opt-Out</h2>
    <p>You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application. To disconnect cloud save features, you can sign out from your connected account within the app settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain minimal usage data for analytics and game progress data for cloud save functionality. If you want your data removed,
      contact <a href="mailto:sajed.atwe@gmail.com">sajed.atwe@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to protect the information collected and stored. Firebase services provide industry-standard security measures for data protection.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      This policy may be updated. Continued use of the app implies acceptance of
      changes. Significant changes will be communicated through the app or our social media channels.
    </p>
